# Falling Rocks

Falling Rocks is a simple game based on an old Windows 3.1 game, Herman and the Falling Rocks. This was made in part to demonstrate how games or programs can be made, from a very high level, to my elementary school aged kid and parts were pair programmed by us together.

The game is a puzzle game in which the player must collect items in an underground setting. The player does not experience gravity but some elements, like rocks, do.
